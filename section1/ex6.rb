#Study Drills
#1. Used octothorpe character to make omments above each line explaining it.
#2. Found all the places where a string is put inside a string:4
#3. Yes, it was in 4 places
#4. Because we are concatenating the string
#5 They still work because uby knows when we want something to be a string when we use either double quotes or single quotes. We just need to pick one and be consistent.
