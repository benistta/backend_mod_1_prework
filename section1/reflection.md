## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I have put some thought on how I learn best. This article resonates with me since some of the things listed here are working for me or I think would work to enhance my learning process. Seeing learning as a process and seeing the importance of breaks is something I already do. I also read a lot but not enough I think, or at least not the kind of books that will help me with a specific topic. My reading usually has to do with Spanish literature. One of my goals for this cohort and for my future as a software developer in general is to do some more instructional reading, and get in the habit of doing that.
I also will try and take better care of my brain. Sleeping well and eating will be one of my goals for this cohort. After a good night sleep I am more eager to learn and more attentive.
