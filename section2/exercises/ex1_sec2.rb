#Study drills
#1. I think it tells to choose one option or the other.
#2. I think it needs to be indentent to separate them from the rest of the script
#3. I think that if isn't indented then  it all gests confusing
#4. Yes I can, it works:

#people = 20
#cats = 30
#dogs = 15


#if people < cats || people > dogs
#  puts "Too many cats! The world is doomed!"
#end

#if people > cats && people< dogs
#  puts "Not many cats! The wrold is saved!"
#end

#if people < dogs
#  puts "The wrold is drooled on!"
#end

#dogs += 5

#if people >= dogs
#  puts "People are greater than or equal to dogs."
#end

#if people <= dogs
#  puts "People are less than or equal to dogs."
#end

#if people != dogs
#  puts "People are dogs."
#end

#5. The numbers are compared and the code runs:

#people = 50
#cats = 70
#dogs = 45


#if people < cats
#  puts "Too many cats! The world is doomed!"
#end

#if people > cats
#  puts "Not many cats! The world is saved!"
#end

#if people < dogs
#  puts "The world is drooled on!"
#end

#if people > dogs
#  puts "The world is dry!"
#end


#dogs += 5

#if people >= dogs
#  puts "People are greater than or equal to dogs."
#end

#if people <= dogs
#  puts "People are less than or equal to dogs."
#end


#if people == dogs
#  puts "People are dogs."
#end
