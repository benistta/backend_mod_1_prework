#Study drills
#1. With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010 and not 2009? (Hint: you can't pick years at random.)
  #Because you cant pick years at random. You have to use ordinal numbers not cardinals. Years go on orden.
#2. Write some more arrays and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.


  music_genres = ['salsa', 'folk', 'country', 'pop', 'romantic']

  puts "The third music genre is #{music_genres[2]}" #=> country
  puts "The fifth music genre is #{music_genres[4]}" #=> romantic
  puts "The second music genre is #{music_genres[1]}" #=> folk
  puts "The first music genre is #{music_genres[0]}" #=> salsa
  puts "The fourth music genre is #{music_genres[3]}" #=> pop
