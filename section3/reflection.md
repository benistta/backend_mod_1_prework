## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
The article talks about how believing you can grow, can improve your learning process. This resonates with me, because I am sure I can learn coding well. I believe in my abilities and I have clear goals. I am also aware of all the time and dedication I need to be able to learn it well.
The article also talked about how focusing on the process, helps you reevaluate the approach and strategies. I found myself doing just that while working on mod0 and mod pre-work. Learning coding is very different from college. Time management is something that I am trying to have in mind as I work and learn coding. I usually like to re-read things and practice and play with the examples given. Due to deadlines, I am finding myself reevaluating short term goals, while making plans on going back and re-reading and practicing.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I think I demonstrate a Growth Mindset by believing I can achieve my goals with effort and practice. I also understand that mistakes are needed to learn something well and I do take criticism well and try to improved and correct any errors I might done.
I don't have yet the problem solving capabilities of a programmer. I plan to work on my Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) as I keep learning and growing as a programmer. I also have to practice setting measurable, achievable goals and breaking down bigger projects into manageable ones.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is a collection of data with keys and values. Arrays have their elements in order and usually have to be the same data type. In an array you can only use number indexes, while in a hash you can use anything not just numbers.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {treats: 245, food: 100, toys: 125}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
puts states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
puts states.keys
puts states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
A school list with grades for each one of the students for different subjects. It would be better than an array because with key/values elements, I could narrow down the search when trying to locate a specific item. Also if I don't know the indexes I wouldn't be able to locate the element I want fast.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
I am still trying to wrap my head around hashes. One question I have is whether or not there are different types of hashes?
